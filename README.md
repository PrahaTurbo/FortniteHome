## General Information
This is a companion app for Fortnite. The app uses non-official API [Fortnite-API](https://dash.fortnite-api.com/) to display current information about the game.

It is written entirely in SwiftUI with just one UIViewRepresentable for WebView. I tried to follow MVVM architecture principles as much as my skills let me.

For loading images I've choosed [NukeUI](https://github.com/kean/NukeUI) rather than build-in AsyncImage because NukeUI works better with Lazy Grid and it does quite a good job in memory managing area.

* SwiftUI 3.0
* NukeUI 0.8.1
